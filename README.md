Predicting Ivy League admission likelihood using linear regression on Jamboree student profiles.
## ðŸŽ¯ About the Project

**Jamboree Education**, Asiaâ€™s leading and largest test preparation institute, has helped thousands of students gain admission into top universities abroad through comprehensive classroom programs for exams such as the **GMAT, GRE, SAT, TOEFL,** and **IELTS**.

Recently, Jamboree introduced an interactive tool on their website that allows students to evaluate their chances of getting into an Ivy League college. This case study explores that initiative by building a predictive model using **Linear Regression** to estimate the probability of graduate admission into Ivy League institutions.

The project not only forecasts admission chances but also investigates which factors most significantly influence successful outcomes. It examines how these variablesâ€”such as test scores, academic performance, and recommendationsâ€”interrelate and impact admission decisions.
